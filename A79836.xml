         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our letter of <hi>May</hi> 2. together with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhips, therein incloſed Declaration, came to my hands the 27 of the ſame, being here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Lady <hi>Dungar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which you deſire I ſhould give my Reſolution by ſome Gentl. expreſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to your Lordſhip, rather then by Letter, but I have fixed on this courſe of writing rather, this being the way leſſe ſubject to miſconſtruction.</p>
            <p>In that your Letter and Declaration, I find your Lordſhip reſolved on a Seſſation, with the Rebels (grounded as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) on miſgovernment in <hi>England,</hi> and on thoſe ſhort ſupplies thence, made over to your Lordſhip, and that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under your command.</p>
            <p>I paſſe by what cauſeth thoſe grievances pretended as from <hi>England,</hi> whereof, as none here can be competent Judges, ſo, can I not conceive why the intereſt in this Service may not be performed and proſecuted, without our over-neer prying into the grounds or parts, in this more remote diſtractions, whereunto none here are called out, as to be ingaged.</p>
            <p>As for your Lordſhips diſcouragements in the ſervice, in your ſo great want of ſupplies, and for ſo long time, I have my Lord, laboured under the ſame perplexities, being every way, and as long, and as neerly pinched with the like evills. Yet as nothing of all that want, though much more, could draw me to reſolutions of expecting a ſubſiſtance from the Rebells, by compliance with them: So, could I never caſt the retarding of our ſupplies out of <hi>Engl.</hi> on any ſiniſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes or diſaffections of the Parliament towards us, but on the home diſtractions rather of <hi>Engl.</hi> which I beſeech God, the God of peace, to make up, as in his good time I nothing doubt, but he will perfectly do.</p>
            <p>The good beginning whereof, even now very hopefully appearing, and we heare at preſent gathering the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits therof, in thoſe plentifull ſupplies deſigned for us,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162042:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 105 -->and more daily expected. And I am very confident your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had before now found the like, and as fully, had not thoſe obſtructions bin moſt unhappily caſt in, which I doubt not but your Lordſhip may yet remove in your timely application to the Parl. which I moſt heartily deſire you would doe, and wherein you cannot want thoſe in Engl. who will very really &amp; effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſerve you. As to thoſe your Invitations given mee, for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that courſe in joyning with the Iriſh in Lemſter &amp; Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; may be avenged the blood of thoſe in whoſe quarrell wee have fought; and thoſe juſt ends accompliſhed which wee ever propoſed to our ſelves. The Lord Taffe &amp; his adherents being content to ſubſcribe (as your Lordſhip ſaith) in Declaration for His Majeſty, &amp; a free Parliament in Engl. Your Lordſhip alſo adding; that upon perfection of the Articles between you; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſhould bee made for mee or any of the Proteſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion who ſhall adhere to the agreement. Wherein I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſatisfied how the Munſter and Lemſter Rebels (being by their Oath of aſſociation; profeſſed enemies of the Proteſtant Religion) and involved in the ſame guilt of blood equally with others of their party; and appearing in the preſent horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, &amp; that principally &amp; above others of that party in other Provinces; ſhould be thought notwithſtanding fit inſtruments to avenge the blood of thoſe in whoſe quarrell we have fought, &amp; for accompliſhing thoſe juſt ends by the Parl. propounded.</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf therfore; I ſhall rather hazzard; that in your Lordſhips Declaration of your reſolution to your beſt power; to give oppoſition to all ſuch as ſhal not co-operate with you in this your intended way. For; as I nothing feare any oppoſing powers; God aſſiſting me in his own cauſe; ſo ſhall no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; or by-reſpects whatſoever; draw me off from that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of fidelity; whereunto I am reſolved to ſtand unmoveable: In order whereunto </p>
